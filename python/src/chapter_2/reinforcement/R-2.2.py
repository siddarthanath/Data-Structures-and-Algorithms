Q: Give an example of a software application in which adaptability can mean
the difference between a prolonged lifetime of sales and bankruptcy.
A: Consider video game software. In the gaming industry, constant updates and 
enhancements—ranging from new features and bug fixes to platform compatibility 
adjustments—are crucial. Failure to adapt to evolving user expectations and 
technological changes can render a game obsolete and financially disastrous, 
while continuous adaptation can sustain long-term sales.
